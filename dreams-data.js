    content: `Living with family in a huge house connected to a bunch of other houses by semi secret corridors which were like little libraries, some corner connecting pieces had a fire place for example, and you could meet other people from different houses in the passageways or go with friends to explore. Some would go extremely highly and you could go out onto rooftops which were on roof tops on roof tops. We made friends with some kids our age from other houses and adventures with them. I cannot express how much fun these tunnels were. Caroline Philip and I along with our new friends would run and climb and jump through these tunnels and find the coolest stuff ever. The tunnels were large enough to bring dogs inside to walk around. I ended up going out on my own for a walk and I went to a grocery store and walked around just for fun. I kept accidentally walking into these two girls’ path and apologizing every time, the last time saying “I am so sorry” really sincerely which they thought was funny. I ended up seeing them get into their car in the parking lot which was a yellow classic race track car with different stickers all over it, some which must have been race stickers like sponsors and stuff, some they would have put on themselves. The side doors were completely removed and the center console was retro futuristic with a led display and lots of knobs and switches. I yelled out that I loved their car, then when they pulled out into the street I kinda fan boy yelled just by how cool the car was. They heard me and revered in the road, then one of the girls snapped a picture of the car for me (I was trying to get a pic for Philip) and texted it to me. They were fun but I wasn’t flirting with them. I ran into a dark skinned homeless man who chased me down while I ran on just my hands between my legs. I ran very fast this way and hoped it would scare him away. But he just wanted me to buy something and kept trying to get me to hold his money for some reason with his buddy who was helping him sell to me. I ran out of the alley and it wasn’t so scary. I ended up on the most beautiful street ever with trees which in my mind were what linen trees look like. Block shaped trees with lines with soft white linen as bark in the center of each side and hard wood on the corners. The linen centers only covered the inner hardwood, but had wonderful woven patterns in them. I jumped and spinned in the air and felt so free and alive. I said to myself that this is a proper adventure, and that’s when I saw the linen trees all in a row on the side of the street. I still remember hugging one and putting my face up to the soft fabric growing from its trunk. As the dream got nearer its end, Caroline was with me at the linen trees and I saw an older man who was examining them too. I said some snarky comment about how “Oh and can you believe this evolved over millions of years” (after seeing the complex linen patterns) and the guy turned to talk to me. I don’t remember what he said but he had invited Caroline and I to a dinner on a train. Her and I were talking about crappy democrat politicians or something and then I turned and saw an old lady who looked very similar to how Hilary Clinton might look these days and she was with a man who was probably a body guard. It ended up not being her but Caroline seemed to think it was for a bit too long, and she said something to the tables around her which implied something about  fake Hillary but the people didn’t really understand. I cut in and said that she doesn’t know what she’s saying, she’s operating under a false assumption. Anyway, I sort of cleared things up then the old man from before came in and pointed everyone’s attention out the window to see this mecha robot figure flying in the sky, almost looked like soft and complex parade balloons though with the rounded colorful shapes it had. Then the parts of the robot, Gundam I should say, came apart and began to form letters in a language I kinda knew while the old man announced the letters as they formed before us. It was like pieces of the robot came apart and each moved into a stance to form the letter. That’s all I can remember. It was one of my top 5 dream of all time. I feel so happy and wish I could just go back. The sad thing about writing your dream is that you can’t try to immediately go back, and once you’ve written it, you’ve almost spoiled the whole thing by thinking about it too much. But I want to remember this one. The friends I met along the way, the amazing adventure, the feeling of being free and having the fun I never get to have in real life. I wouldn’t give that up for the world. Thank you God for this.`,
