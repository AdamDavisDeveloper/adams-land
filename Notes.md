### Sep. 18th 21

Working on my garden. Rain is falling steadily outside my open windows. I have The Office playing on mute with live lofi chill-hop music in the background. I'm doing my favorite thing (coding) and the environment is perfect.

### A dream I had Sep. 16th 21

I accidentally left something on my nightstand which soaked into the handcrafted wood and basically ruined it. I tried scrubbing it really hard with paper towels for some reason but ended up chipping and tearing pieces of the wood off instead.
