My little slice of the internet. Nothing is perfect. It's always in a state of development and that's how I like it. Hyper personal website built using basic technologies (and firestore, shh..) - just for fun. ðŸŒ±

## dev notes

when running your dev server locally, run `netlify dev` which will run on `localhost:8888` & pull env vars from netlify dashboard to use in the project. :-)
